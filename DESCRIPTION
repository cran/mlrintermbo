Title: Model-Based Optimization for 'mlr3' Through 'mlrMBO'
Description: The 'mlrMBO' package can ordinarily not be used for optimization within 'mlr3', because of
  incompatibilities of their respective class systems. 'mlrintermbo' offers a compatibility
  interface that provides 'mlrMBO' as an 'mlr3tuning' 'Tuner' object, for tuning of machine
  learning algorithms within 'mlr3', as well as a 'bbotk' 'Optimizer' object for optimization
  of general objective functions using the 'bbotk' black box optimization framework. The
  control parameters of 'mlrMBO' are faithfully reproduced as a 'paradox' 'ParamSet'.
